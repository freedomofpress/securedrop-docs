The Admin Interface
===================

The *Admin Interface* is an extended version of the *Journalist Interface*, that
allows you to manage users and configure the appearance and behaviour of your
instance's web interfaces.

Logging in
^^^^^^^^^^

To log in to the *Admin Interface*, start the *Admin Workstation*
with persistence enabled. Open the *SecureDrop Menu* and select the
"Launch Journalist Interface" option. Tor Browser will start and load the login
page for the *Journalist Interface*. Use your username, passphrase, and
two-factor authentication token to log in.

By default, you will be logged in to the *Journalist Interface*'s source list page.

|SecureDrop main page|

In the course of normal administration operations you should not need to view source
communications, but if you do, you can find information on managing submissions in
the :doc:`journalist guide <../../journalist/journalist>`.

.. note::
  If you have lost your login information or your two-factor authentication is no longer
  valid, you can create another account with admin privileges via the command line
  on the *Application Server*. See :ref:`here <Create Admin CLI>` for more information.


.. _User Management:

User Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the *Admin Interface* to add and remove users, and to reset their
credentials if necessary. To open the *Admin Interface*, click **Admin** in the
upper right corner of the *Journalist Interface*.

.. _Adding Users:

Adding Users
------------

After logging in, you can add new user accounts for the journalists at your organization
who will be checking the system for submissions. Make sure the journalist is
physically in the same room as you when you do this, as they will have to be present
to enable two-factor authentication. SecureDrop supports the use of either a
smartphone authenticator app or a Yubikey for two-factor authentication. If an
app is to be used, the journalist should install it before proceeding with the
account setup.

.. include:: ../../includes/otp-app.txt

#. Click **Admin** in the top right corner of the page to load the *Admin Interface*.

   |SecureDrop admin home|

#. Click **Add User** to add a new user.

   |Add a new user|

#. Hand the keyboard over to the journalist so they can create their own username.
#. Once theyâ€™re done entering a username for themselves, have them save their pre-generated Diceware passphrase to their password manager.
#. If the new account should also have admin privileges, allowing them to add or delete other journalist accounts, select **Is Admin**.
#. Finally, set up two-factor authentication for the account, following one of the two procedures below for your chosen method.

.. note::
   The username **deleted** is reserved, as it is used to mark accounts which
   have been deleted from the system.


FreeOTP
~~~~~~~

#. If the journalist is using FreeOTP or another app for two-factor authentication, click **Add User** to proceed to the next page.

   |Enable FreeOTP|

#. Next, the journalist should open FreeOTP on their smartphone and scan the barcode displayed on the screen.
#. If they have difficulty scanning the barcode, they can tap on the icon at the top that shows a plus and the symbol of a key and use their phone's keyboard to input the two-factor secret into the ``Secret`` input field, without whitespace.
#. Inside the FreeOTP app, a new entry for this account will appear on the main screen, with a six-digit number that recycles to a new number every thirty seconds.  The journalist should enter the six-digit number in the  **Verification code** field at the bottom of the **Enable FreeOTP** form and click **Submit**.

If two-factor authentication was set up successfully, you will be redirected back
to the *Admin Interface* and will see a confirmation that the two-factor code was
verified.

YubiKey
~~~~~~~

#. If the journalist wishes to use a YubiKey for two-factor authentication, select **Is using a YubiKey**. You will then need to enter their YubiKey's OATH-HOTP Secret Key. For more information on how to retrieve this key, read the :doc:`YubiKey Setup Guide <../deployment/yubikey_setup>`.

   |Enable YubiKey|

#. Once you've entered the Yubikey's OATH-HOTP Secret Key, click **Add User**.  On the next page, have the journalist authenticate using their YubiKey, by inserting it into a USB port on the workstation and pressing its button.

   |Verify YubiKey|

#. If everything was set up correctly, you will be redirected back to the *Admin Interface*, where you should see a flashed message that says "The two-factor code for user *new username* was verified successfully.".

The journalist will require their username, passphrase, and two-factor authentication
method whenever they check SecureDrop. Make sure that they have memorised their
username and passphrase, or stored them in their password manager, and that they
can keep their two-factor authentication device secure.


Passphrases and Two-Factor Resets
---------------------------------

.. warning:: Both of these operations will lock a user out of their
   SecureDrop account. Users should be physically present when their passphrase
   or two-factor authentication method is reset. If this is not possible, store
   the passphrase and/or two-factor authentication secret in your own password
   manager before securely transmitting them to the user in question, and delete
   them once the user has confirmed they can successfully log in.

Even while following :ref:`passphrase best practices <passphrase_best_practices>`,
your journalists may occasionally lock themselves out of their accounts. This
can happen if, for example, they lose their two-factor device or if they
forget the passphrase to their password manager. When this happens, you
can reset their account as follows:

#. Log in as an administrator to the *Journalist Interface*
#. Select *Admin* at the top right to open the *Admin Interface*
#. Find the user's account name and select **Edit**

|Reset Passphrase|

Next, you can either rotate their passphrase or reset two-factor authentication
for their account.

To change their passphrase to the randomly-generated passphrase shown:

  #. Have the journalist enter their current passphrase and two-factor code.
  #. Make sure the new passphrase is saved in a password manager.
  #. Click **Reset Password**

To reset two-factor authentication:

  #. Click the button that corresponds to the user's chosen two-factor authentication method:

     * Click **Reset Mobile App Credentials** for accounts using FreeOTP or a similar authentication app
     * Click **Reset Security Key Credentials** for accounts using a Yubikey

  #. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process and verify their new two-factor authentication credentials.


Off-boarding Users
------------------

See :doc:`our guide to off-boarding users from SecureDrop <../deployment/offboarding>`.

Instance Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Instance Configuration section of the *Admin Interface* allows you to:

* update the organization name and logo displayed on the *Source* and *Journalist Interfaces*
* set submission preferences for the *Source Interface*
* send test OSSEC alerts.

Updating the Organization Name
------------------------------

Your organization name is used in page titles and logo ALT text on the
*Source Interface* and *Journalist Interface*. By default, it's set to ``SecureDrop``.
To change it, enter your desired name in the Organization Name field and click
**Set Organization Name**.

.. _Updating Logo Image:

Updating the Logo Image
-----------------------

You can update the system logo shown on the web interfaces of your SecureDrop
instance via the *Admin Interface*. We recommend a size of ``500px x 450px``. Only
PNG-format images are supported. To update the logo image:

#. Copy the logo image to your admin workstation
#. Click **Browse** and select the image from your workstation's filesystem
#. Click **Update Logo** to upload and set the new logo

You should see a message appear indicating the change was a success.

|Logo Update|

It may be necessary to hold the Shift key while pressing the Reload button in 
the browser, which will force it to purge the cached version of the logo
in order to see the new one.

.. _test-OSSEC-alert:

Testing OSSEC Alerts
--------------------

To verify that the OSSEC monitoring system's functionality, you can send a test
OSSEC alert by clicking **Send Test OSSEC Alert**.

|Test Alert|

You should receive an OSSEC alert email at the address specified during the
installation of SecureDrop. The email may take several minutes to arrive. If
you don't receive it, refer to the :doc:`OSSEC Guide<../maintenance/ossec_alerts>`
for information on troubleshooting steps.


.. _submission prefs:

Submission Preferences
----------------------

The Submission Preferences subsection allows you to restrict the types of submissions
accepted by your instance.

Disabling Document Uploads
--------------------------

By default, SecureDrop supports both text submissions and document uploads. If you
only want to receive text messages, you can disable uploads as follows:

#. Check the **Prevent sources from uploading documents** checkbox
#. Click **Update Submission Preferences**

This change will be applied immediately on the *Source Interface*. Documents that
were previously uploaded will still be available via the *Journalist Interface*.

Preventing Short Initial Messages
---------------------------------

By default, SecureDrop does not apply a minimum length requirement to messages. If
your instance is experiencing a high volume of short one-time messages with no actionable
content, or if you would like to indicate to sources that their initial message
should include enough information for journalists to respond to them effectively, you
can set an initial message length as follows:

#. Check the **Prevent sources from sending initial messages shorter than the minimum required length** checkbox
#. Enter the desired minimum length in the field below the checkbox
#. Click **Update Submission Preferences**

This change will be applied immediately on the Source Interface. Initial messages that
are too short will be rejected, with an error message informing sources of the
requirement. This requirement will not be applied to initial messages that also include a document,
or to subsequent messages in the conversation.

To remove the requirement, uncheck the checkbox and click **Update Submission Preferences**.

Preventing Initial Messages Containing the Source's Codename
------------------------------------------------------------

Sources should never need to share their seven-word codename with journalists. If
your instance is receiving one-time messages consisting of the source's codename,
you can optionally reject those messages, before they are stored, as follows:

#. Check the **Prevent sources from submitting their codename as an initial message** checkbox
#. Click **Update Submission Preferences**

This change will be applied immediately on the Source Interface. Initial messages that
contain the source's codename will be rejected, with an error message reminding sources
to protect their codename and keep it secret. To remove this restriction, uncheck the
checkbox and click **Update Submission Preferences**.
