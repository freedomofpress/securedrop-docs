Upgrade from 2.6.1 to 2.7.0
===========================

.. note::

   This release will remove support for submission PGP keys with legacy 
   SHA-1-based binding signatures. The SecureDrop Journalist Interface
   will not start when the instance has been configured with such a key.
   If you have set up SecureDrop according to our documentation, you are
   not using such keys; no SecureDrop instances known to us are affected
   by this change.

   If you are unsure if you will be affected by this change, you can 
   reach out to us for support. Our recommended course of action is to
   check your Submission Public Key, available at the /public-key
   endpoint of your SecureDrop Source Interface onion url, using the
   ``sq-keyring-linter`` program installable on your Admin Workstation.
   If your key contains insecure SHA-1-based signatures, we suggest
   creating a new Submission Keypair according to our documentation.
   You should not delete the old key from your Secure Viewing Station,
   so that you can still decrypt old submissions. We are happy to 
   assist you with this process. As a reminder, all key material should
   be generated on an air-gapped machine, and should never reside on a
   network-connected device.

   For more detailed information about why keys with SHA-1 signatures are
   insecure, see https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2023/02/01/202302-happy-sha1-day/.

Update Servers to SecureDrop 2.7.0
----------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.7.0
---------------------------------------

Updating Tails and replacing short passphrases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before upgrading your Workstations to SecureDrop 2.7.0, we 
strongly recommend that you first upgrade to Tails 5.19.

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.7.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.7.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.7.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.7.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig
