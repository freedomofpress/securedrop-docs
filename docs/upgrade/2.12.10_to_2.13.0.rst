Upgrade from 2.12.10 to 2.13.0
==============================

Changes in SecureDrop 2.13.0
----------------------------

SecureDrop 2.13.10 marks a major change from previous versions as the ``securedrop-admin`` tool is now provided as a Debian package installed on Tails using ``apt`` and available system-wide, rather than as a tool that must be run directly from a local cloned version of the SecureDrop repository. 

After you have successfully performed this upgrade on an *Admin Workstation*, the ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory is no longer used. Configuration files for your SecureDrop are moved to ``~/.config/securedrop-admin`` and stored there going forward. Running ``securedrop-admin`` commands is different two important  ways: you no longer need to run them from the ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory and you should not include a leading ``./``. 

For more details, see the `announcement for this release <https://securedrop.org/news/securedrop-2_13_0-released/>`_. 

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.13.0
----------------------------------------

.. important:: We recommend backing up your workstations prior to
  any upgrades. See our :ref:`backup instructions <backup_workstations>`
  for more information.

Update to SecureDrop 2.13.10 using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.net/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.13.10 by clicking "Update Now":

Fallback: Perform a manual update
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.13.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.13.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.13.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  sudo apt update
  ./securedrop-admin setup
