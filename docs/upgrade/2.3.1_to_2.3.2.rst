Upgrade from 2.3.1 to 2.3.2
===========================

Update Servers to SecureDrop 2.3.2
----------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.3.2
---------------------------------------

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.3.2 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.3.2

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.3.2

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.3.2' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Upgrade to Tails 5.0
--------------------

.. important::

   You must upgrade your workstations to SecureDrop 2.3.2 by following the steps
   above *before* upgrading to Tails 5.0. You can verify the version of SecureDrop
   by running ``git status`` in your ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory. The
   output should include "HEAD detached at 2.3.2".

Tails 5.0 is the first version of Tails to be based on Debian 11 ("Bullseye").
Among the most noticeable changes is the switch to a new frontend for GnuPG
called Kleopatra. Once you upgrade your *Secure Viewing Station*, you will need
to use Kleopatra to open ``.gpg`` files. Please see our :doc:`Journalist Guide <../journalist>`
for more information.

You must perform the upgrade to Tails 5.0 manually. You need a blank USB drive
that you can install Tails 5.0 USB on from scratch. You will use this drive
to upgrade your *Journalist Workstation(s)*, your *Admin Workstation(s)*, and your
*Secure Viewing Station(s)*.

The persistent storage volumes of your USB drives will be migrated as part of
this upgrade, but we still highly recommend backing them up first. Follow the
steps for :ref:`updating Tails manually <Update Tails Manually>`.

Update Tails
------------
Follow the graphical prompts to update to the latest version of the Tails
operating system on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*.

.. important ::

   Older versions of Tails had problems with automatic updates, which SecureDrop
   tries to correct automatically. Check the version of Tails on your *Admin* and
   *Journalist Workstations* (**Applications ▸ Tails ▸ About Tails**). If you are
   running a version older than Tails 4.23, and did not receive an automatic
   upgrade prompt after connecting to the Internet, perform a
   :ref:`manual update <Update Tails Manually>`. If this also fails, please
   don't hesitate to contact us.
