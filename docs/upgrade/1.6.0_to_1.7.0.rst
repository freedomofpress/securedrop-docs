Upgrade from 1.6.0 to 1.7.0
===========================

.. important::

  Please see the :ref:`key reminders <key_reminders>` below regarding critical
  migrations of your SecureDrop servers that must be completed before
  **April 30, 2021** to keep your instance operational.

Automatic server upgrades
-------------------------
As with previous releases, your servers will be upgraded to the latest version
of SecureDrop automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Updating Workstations to SecureDrop 1.7.0
-----------------------------------------

Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 1.7.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2224 5C81 E3BA EB41 38B3 6061 310F 5612 00F4 AD77"
  git tag -v 1.7.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 22245C81E3BAEB4138B36061310F561200F4AD77
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key"

Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. If it does, you can check out the
new release: ::

    git checkout 1.7.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '1.7.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Upgrading Tails
---------------

If you have already upgraded your workstations to the Tails 4 series, follow the
graphical prompts to update to the latest version.

.. important::

   If you are still running Tails 3.x on any workstation, we urge you to update
   to the Tails 4 series as soon as possible. Tails 3.x is no longer receiving
   security updates, and is no longer supported by the SecureDrop team.
   Please see our
   :doc:`instructions for upgrading to Tails 4 <../upgrade_to_tails_4>`.

   These instructions will be removed from a future version of this
   documentation.

Migration to v3 onion services
------------------------------

Support for v2 :ref:`onion services <glossary_onion_service>` is being phased
out and will be completely removed as part of the transition to Ubuntu 20.04.
If you are not already running v3 onion services (easily recognizable by their
56 character ``.onion`` addresses), please complete the migration at your
earliest convenience to keep your instance running. See our
:doc:`upgrade guide <../v3_services>` for details.

Preparing for Ubuntu 20.04
--------------------------
The current server operating system, Ubuntu 16.04, will no longer receive
security updates after April 30, 2021. Support for Ubuntu 20.04 is planned
for the SecureDrop 1.8.0 release, scheduled for March 2, 2021. We recommend
that you schedule a two-day maintenance window **between March 9 and April 30**.

Before then, we encourage you to take :doc:`preparatory steps <focal_prep>`
to ensure that the migration will go smoothly.

Getting Support
