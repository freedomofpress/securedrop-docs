Upgrade from 2.5.2 to 2.6.0
===========================

Update Servers to SecureDrop 2.6.0
----------------------------------
Servers running Ubuntu 20.04 will be updated to the latest version of SecureDrop
automatically within 24 hours of the release.

Update Workstations to SecureDrop 2.6.0
---------------------------------------

Updating Tails and replacing short passphrases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before upgrading your Workstations to SecureDrop 2.6.0, we 
strongly recommend that you first upgrade to Tails 5.14, which includes
important updates to disk encryption and passphrase hashing algorithms. 

We also recommend updating all other encrypted drives to LUKS2, and ensuring
you have strong passphrases.

We have issued a Security Advisory, which provides detailed instructions for
updating the Workstations, as well as any other encrypted drives. You can find
that `advisory on the SecureDrop website.
<https://securedrop.org/news/security-advisory-update-encrypted-usb-drives-and-replace-short-passphrases/>`_


Using the graphical updater
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

   If you encounter errors with the graphical updater, perform a
   manual update. This will ensure that you have imported the new
   `SecureDrop release signing key <https://media.securedrop.org/media/documents/signing-key-transition.txt>`_.

On the next boot of your SecureDrop *Journalist* and *Admin Workstations*,
the *SecureDrop Workstation Updater* will alert you to workstation updates. You
must have `configured an administrator password <https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/welcome_screen/administration_password/>`_
on the Tails welcome screen in order to use the graphical updater.

Perform the update to 2.6.0 by clicking "Update Now":

Performing a manual update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the graphical updater fails and you want to perform a manual update instead,
first delete the graphical updater's temporary flag file, if it exists (the
``.`` before ``securedrop`` is not a typo): ::

  rm ~/Persistent/.securedrop/securedrop_update.flag

This will prevent the graphical updater from attempting to re-apply the failed
update and has no bearing on future updates. You can now perform a manual
update by running the following commands: ::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop
  git fetch --tags
  gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-key \
   "2359 E653 8C06 13E6 5295 5E6C 188E DD3B 7B22 E6A3"
  git tag -v 2.6.0

The output should include the following two lines: ::

    gpg:                using RSA key 2359E6538C0613E652955E6C188EDD3B7B22E6A3
    gpg: Good signature from "SecureDrop Release Signing Key <securedrop-release-key-2021@freedom.press>" [unknown]


Please verify that each character of the fingerprint above matches what is
on the screen of your workstation. A warning that the key is not certified
is normal and expected. If the output includes the lines above, you can check
out the new release: ::

    git checkout 2.6.0

.. important:: If you do see the warning "refname '2.6.0' is ambiguous" in the
  output, we recommend that you contact us immediately at securedrop@freedom.press
  (`GPG encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Finally, run the following commands: ::

  ./securedrop-admin setup
  ./securedrop-admin tailsconfig

Update Tails
------------
Follow the graphical prompts to update to the latest version of the Tails
operating system on your *Admin* and *Journalist Workstations*.

If you have not already done so, you must manually upgrade from the Tails 4 release
series to the Tails 5 series.

Upgrade from Tails 4 to Tails 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. important::

   You must upgrade your workstations to the latest version of SecureDrop by following
   the steps above *before* upgrading to the Tails 5 series. You can verify the version
   of SecureDrop by running ``git status`` in your ``~/Persistent/securedrop`` directory.
   The output should include "HEAD detached at 2.6.0".

The Tails 5 series is based on Debian 11 ("Bullseye"). Among the most noticeable
changes is the switch to a new frontend for GnuPG called Kleopatra. Once you
upgrade your *Secure Viewing Station*, you will need to use Kleopatra to open
``.gpg`` files. Please see our :ref:`Journalist Guide <decrypting>`
for more information.

You must perform the upgrade to Tails 5 manually. You need a blank USB drive
that you can install the latest release in the Tails 5 series on from scratch.
You will use this drive to upgrade your *Journalist Workstation(s)*, your
*Admin Workstation(s)*, and your *Secure Viewing Station(s)*.

The persistent storage volumes of your USB drives will be migrated as part of
this upgrade, but we still highly recommend backing them up first. Follow the
steps for :ref:`updating Tails manually <Update Tails Manually>`.

Fore each *Journalist* and *Admin Workstation*, perform the following additional
steps to complete the upgrade:

1. Boot the USB drive
2. On the Tails welcome screen, unlock the persistent volume and configure an
   administrator password
3. Open a terminal (**Applications ▸ Utilities ▸ Terminal**)
4. Run the following commands:

::

  cd ~/Persistent/securedrop/admin
  rm -rf .venv3
  cd ..
  ./securedrop-admin setup

When prompted by Tails to "Install Only Once" or "Install Every Time", click
**Install Every Time** (this is a change from previous versions of Tails).
