Getting Support
===============

Whether you are interested in learning more about SecureDrop, looking for
help with an installation, or needing assistance with an existing
SecureDrop instance, there are several support options available to you.

Freedom of the Press Foundation offers direct :ref:`support via Signal <support_via_signal>`. 

If you are unable to use Signal, you can always contact us by e-mail at securedrop@freedom.press (`PGP encrypted <https://securedrop.org/sites/default/files/fpf-email.asc>`__).

Additionally, there is also some level of :ref:`Community Support <community_support>`.

.. note::

   If your installation is up and running, we recommend that you
   `submit your SecureDrop to the SecureDrop directory <https://securedrop.org/directory/submit/>`__.
   This also serves as a first introduction to the SecureDrop team.

While we will provide technical assistance within reason and at our discretion, we encourage you to consider a paid support agreement to receive priority support, staff training, or installation help. Visit the `Priority Support <https://securedrop.org/priority-support/>`_ and `Training <https://securedrop.org/training/>`_ pages on the SecureDrop website for more information.

Support via Signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of the sensitive nature of SecureDrop-related communications, we prefer providing support via the encrypted platform `Signal  <https://signal.org>`__.

Once we have connected with you on Signal, you will receive notifications regarding SecureDrop releases and security advisories, and you will be able to contact us with detailed requests for technical support.

Initial onboarding
------------------

Please start by submitting a request through the `SecureDrop Contact Form`_.

.. _SecureDrop Contact Form: https://securedrop.org/help

Please provide an email address so we can reply back to you. We'll review your
request and decide how to respond. If we decide to offer you support, we will
send you instructions for onboarding you into a Signal group for your organization.

Using Signal
------------

Signal must first be installed on an Android or iOS device and a phone number is required to create an account. A multi-platform desktop application is available which can sync messages and contacts with the mobile application. We recommend using the `official Signal website <https://signal.org/download>`__ for links and detailed instructions to install Signal on your devices. 

Freedom of the Press Foundation has several guides to using Signal:

- `Signal for beginners <https://freedom.press/digisec/blog/signal-beginners/>`__
- `Locking down Signal <https://freedom.press/digisec/blog/locking-down-signal/>`__
- `Understanding every one of Signal's identifiers <https://freedom.press/digisec/blog/signal-identifiers/>`__
