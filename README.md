SecureDrop is an open-source whistleblower submission system that media organizations can use to securely accept documents from, and communicate with anonymous sources. It was originally created by the late Aaron Swartz and is currently managed by the [Freedom of the Press Foundation](https://freedom.press).

This repository is used to build the [public end user documentation](https://docs.securedrop.org/) for SecureDrop.

For developer documentation, please see https://developers.securedrop.org/ and the [corresponding GitHub repository](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-dev-docs/).

## Quickstart

1. [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Install the dependencies using `poetry install`
3. Run `make docs` to start a live build of the documentation at http://localhost:8000
4. Edit [RST](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) files under the docs directory - your changes will be reflected in the live build
