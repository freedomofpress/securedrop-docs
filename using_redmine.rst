Onboarding Issue
----------------

By the time you log in, we'll have created an initial issue for
onboarding, called "Onboarding Verification". Please write a reply on
this issue, which will let us know that you succeeded in logging in and
finding your project page.

|OnboardingIssue|

To write a reply, click **Edit** button at the top of the issue.
Write your reply in the Notes text box, then click **Submit**.

|EditIssue1|

We'll reply to the issue and start a little exchange to explain some
features of the platform and answer any questions you might have. The
goal here is to make sure you're comfortable and confident using the new
Support site.

|EditIssue2|

Once we're satisfied you're ready to use the new site, we'll close the
issue.

Once we're finished with the onboarding issue, you're ready to use the Support
site. If you want to additionally set up encrypted email notifications, head
over to the :doc:`Encrypted Email Overview <encrypted_email_overview>`.

The rest of this documentation is for your reference.
